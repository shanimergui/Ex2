## About The Project:

The project's subject is about a weighted and directed graph. The source is pointing towards the destination. In between them, on the edgde there is the weight.

## The 2 Parts:

This project is composed of 2 different parts : 

1) In the first part, we have api that is a collection of algorithms on a directed weighted graph.
Api will help us developping the nodes, graph, edges and the connections.
In this part we are also interested in finding the shortest path with api.

2)  In the second part, we are using the information contained in the first part such as a directed and weighted graph to create the game. 
This part is a game client where we enter information such as levels and id, we also inserted/created : the pokemon images, created the move of catching Pokemon and putting them on the graph, created the gui of the graph display.
